# UDHBot
A Discord.NET bot made for the server Unity Developer Community 
Join us at https://discord.gg/bu3bbby !

The code is provided as-is and there will be no guaranteed support to help make it run.

# Compiling
## Dependencies
To successfully compile you will need the following.
- [Discord.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Discord.Net/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)

# Running
Once the above has been done, you'll need to setup a few additional things to get the bot to a functional point.

- Copy the "**Server**" folder to the build location. If you run the bot, it'll inform you where that location is as an error.
- Copy the "**Settings**" to the Server folder, without the "**Deserialized**" folder.
- Make another copy of the "**Settings.example.json**" and rename it to "**Settings.json**"
- Walk through the new "**Settings.json**" file and ensure the Bot Token and "**DbConnectionString**" have been set.

*Several comments have been placed throughout the settings file to indicate what needs changing as well as the settings which aren't currently used.*

*If you plan on running the bot outside of the IDE, you will want to give [Discord Net Deployment](https://discord.foxbot.me/docs/guides/deployment/deployment.html) a read.*

## Dependencies
You will need an accessible SQL database setup, the easiest way to do this is using XAMPP which can host the database and make it easier to setup.
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

If you run the bot now, it will attempt to generate the table for the database. Depending on the permisions of the user, it may fail. You can get around by importing one of the tables below through phpmyadmin. 
- ~~**Emptyusers.sql** An empty table that only creates the database structure.~~ (Not yet)
- ~~**Mockusers.sql** A table that creates the database structure, but contains some mock user data as well.~~ (Not yet)

*Once you have imported the database, be sure to create a user in phpmyadmin which can access the database, and the details match your **DbConnectionString**.*

# Notes
I'll re-introduce some of this later.
~~When you hit run, you'll probably see some warnings and errors if you've sped through this without much thought.~~
~~- ***Yellow*** : Warnings *(The bot will continue to run, but may disable some features)*~~
~~- ***Red*** : Errors *(Usually a pending exception/crash is moments away)*~~

I strongly suggest giving [Discord.Net API Documention](https://discord.foxbot.me/stable/api/index.html) a read when interacting with systems you haven't seen before. Discord Net uses Tasks, Asynchronous Patterns and heavy use of Polymorphism, some systems might not always be straight forward.

# Faq
None yet, ask some, I might add them, additional help isn't garenteed. ~~get gud~~
